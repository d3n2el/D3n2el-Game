// Setup game canvas in js

    //Create simple rectangle to test with

    // Make it movabl with user input
        // Change velocity of a character
        // Use x and y coordinates to help with movement
        // Once it starts to move, make sure to remove the rectangle
        //from its starting place so that it doesn't just become a straight line
        // setup canvas limits so that it doesn't disappear into nothing
        // Make sure that everything works and test it 100 times
